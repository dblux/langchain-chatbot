# LangChain ChatBot

Implementation of a salesperson chatbot that helps to answer customer queries. Chatbot is aware of conversation history and accesses business information required to answer customer queries through the use of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Chatbot is implemented using LangChain and uses a open-source LLM served locally by Ollama.
